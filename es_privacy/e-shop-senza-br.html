<h2>SALE TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
<p></p>

<h2>
    Art. 1 - Validity and scope of application of the Sale Terms and
    Conditions - Delivery and shipping
</h2>
<p>
    These terms and conditions of sale (henceforth the
    "<b>Agreement</b>\") exclusively govern Esaote
    North America, Inc.'s ("ESAOTE") sale, and the
    purchase and use by you ("Customer"),
    of the Products, as defined below, through the ESAOTE E-Commerce
    channel referred to in the
    site <a href="http://eshop.esaote.com">eshop.esaote.com</a>(the "<b>ESAOTE
        Site</b>"). Upon Customer's
    receipt of
    ESAOTE's confirmation that Customer's online order has been
    accepted, this Agreement shall constitute
    the entire agreement relating to the purchase of the Products.
</p>
<p>
    "Product(s)" refers to the medical
    equipment and relative new or used accessories, consumer goods, accessories,
    probes and spare parts as specified in
    the Online Order (henceforth also "Order(s)". Online
    Orders have a contractual offer and ESAOTE
    reserves the right to send the Customer specific communication of
    non-acceptance of the Order in the event that the
    Product(s) were/are not available due to Product unavailability. In the
    event that the Product(s) is not available,
    ESAOTE will refund the Customer the amount relating to the purchase
    price with the same method with which the
    payment was made. Delivery of the Product(s) must be understood as
    carriage paid, with all related effects on the
    transfer of risk. The Product(s) will be shipped to the address
    specified in the Order. ESAOTE reserves the right
    to verify the consistency of the address indicated with respect to its
    installed base, and the right to choose the
    carrier and shipping methods. Product Delivery means ground floor. Delivery
    terms will be specified
    during the purchase process and run from the date of the Order transmission
    to ESAOTE or from the actual receipt by
    ESAOTE of the amount due from the Customer as the Price of the purchased
    Product(s). It is understood that the
    delivery terms provided are in any case indicative. ESAOTE is not
    responsible for delays in delivery or failures
    due to causes beyond its reasonable control, nor can the carrier chosen
    by ESAOTE be considered an ESAOTE agent.
    Late delivery for any part of the Order does not give the Customer the
    right to cancel the Order. ESAOTE is not
    liable for non-delivery or late delivery due to causes beyond its
    control or for reasons of proven force
    majeure. If at any moment of the delivery the Customer refuses the
    Product, they will not be reimbursed for the
    related delivery expenses already paid in.
</p>
<p></p>

<h2>
    Art. 2 - Online Order(s)
</h2>
<p>Once the Products have been selected and the relative payment has been
    made, where the Product(s)
    is available, the Customer will receive an Order confirmation e-mail,
    indicating the Order number and a
    summary of all the Customer data entered in the Order. The Order
    confirmation e-mail is not ESAOTE's
    acceptance of the Order, but acknowledgement that ESAOTE has received
    Customer's Order. The Customer
    undertakes to verify its correctness and to promptly communicate any
    corrections through Customer Service
    (<a href="mailto:eshop@esaote.com">eshop@esaote.com</a> ). The Order
    number must correspond to the one used in
    any
    other communication with
    ESAOTE. In the event that the Product(s) is not available, ESAOTE will
    refund the Customer the amount relating to
    the purchase price with the same method with which the payment was
    made. If
    ESAOTE accepts Customer's
    Order, ESAOTE will email customer acceptance of the Order. Customer
    Service
    is where reports and/or information
    requests about the status of shipments can be made (<a
        href="mailto:eshop@esaote.com">eshop@esaote.com</a>). ESAOTE
    reserves the right to refuse
    requests for information and/or Orders from:
</p>
<ul>
    <li style="margin-left:20px;list-style-position:outside;"> a Customer with
        whom there is an ongoing legal dispute;</li>
    <li style="margin-left:20px;list-style-position:outside;"> a Customer who
        has previously violated the conditions and/or terms of this Agreement</li>

        entered false, incomplete or otherwise inexact identification data.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<h2>
    Art. 3 &ndash; Delivery and Transportation
</h2>
<p>ESAOTE will notify Customer of the approximate delivery date(s) of the
    Products, but ESAOTE does
    not guarantee a particular date of delivery. Delivery shall be F.O.B.
    common carrier, ESAOTE's shipping
    point. Title to the Product(s) and liability for loss or damage thereto
    in transit shall pass to Customer upon
    ESAOTE's delivery of the Product(s) to a common carrier for
    shipment to Customer.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>
    Art. 4 - Product Purchase Price
</h2>
<p>The Purchase Price of products published on the ESAOTE Site are in U.S.
    Dollars and include taxes.
    ESAOTE reserves the right to change the Product Purchase Price at any
    time, without notice; it is understood
    that the Purchase Price relating to Product(s) acquired by the Customer
    will not be changed with regard to
    Purchase Price specified in the Online Order accepted by ESAOTE. Delivery
    charges are at the
    Customer's expense, unless otherwise indicated in the purchase procedure.
    The amount (including VAT) of
    these expenses, which may vary in relation to the Product(s) purchased and
    the destination, will be indicated
    separately before the Customer confirms the Online Order. For delivery
    of Products in certain territorial
    areas, specifically indicated during the purchase procedure, the payment
    of a surcharge ("expense
    contribution") may be required, the exact amount of which will be
    clearly indicated during the
    purchase procedure and before the transmission of the Order. Where
    applicable, the customer is responsible for
    customs charges and duties, which will not be reimbursed in the event
    of termination, for any reason, of the
    purchase contract, including the case of Return. In any case, the
    amount due by way of non-refundable customs
    charges and duties in the event of termination of the purchase contract
    will be explicitly indicated in the
    purchase procedure, before the Customer sends the Order. In the Order
    summary and, therefore, before the
    Customer proceeds with its transmission, the total price of the Order
    will be indicated, with a separate
    indication of the delivery costs and any other possible additional expense.
    This total, which will also be
    indicated to the Customer in the Order confirmation e-mail, will constitute
    the total amount due by the
    Customer in relation to the Order.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>
    Art. 5 - Payments
</h2>
<p>This Agreement is valid only for the Products to be located and used
    within the territory of the fifty states
    of the United States of America (the "Territory";) ; price, terms,
    warranty and all other
    conditions of this Agreement are void if the Products are located
    outside the Territory. The Purchase
    Price payment owed by the Customer is paid at the same time as when the
    Online Order is entered. Purchased
    Product payment on the ESAOTE Site can be made using the payment methods
    indicated during purchase
    procedure. If the Customer chooses the bank transfer payment method,
    ESAOTE will send the Order confirmation to
    the Customer following receipt of the amounts to be transferred. Such
    confirmation is not ESAOTE's
    acceptance of the Order, but acknowledgement that ESAOTE has received
    Customer's Order. ESAOTE
    reserves the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement in the event of
    non-payment of the Purchase Price or
    payment/non-payment in breach of the terms specified in the Online Order
    and/or these Sale Conditions.</p>

<h2>
    Art. 7 - Cancellation
